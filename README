= Name

Jabber::Observable - An easy to use, observable Jabber client library with
PubSub support.

= Synopsis

  # Send a message to a friend, asking for authorization if necessary:
  im = Jabber::Observable.new("user@example.com", "password")
  im.deliver("friend@example.com", "Hey there friend!")

  # Register a new observer for incoming messages:
  observer = SomeObserverClass.new
  im.add_observer(:message, observer)

  # Unregister the observer:
  im.delete_observer(:message, observer)

  # Send an authorization request to a user:
  im.subs.add("friend@example.com")

  # Remove a user from your contact list:
  im.subs.remove("unfriendly@example.com")

  # Create a PubSub node:
  im.pubsub.create_node("/mynode")

  # Publishing something to the node:
  im.pubsub.publish_simple_item("/mynode", "body", "something")

  # Subscribing to a node:
  im.pubsub.subscribe_to("/othernode")

  # Get my nodes:
  im.pubsub.my_nodes

  # Get my subscriptions:
  im.pubsub.subscriptions

  # Register an observer for events on nodes I subscribed to:
  im.add_observer(:event, observer)

  # Attach an auto-observer (this gets everything that can be observed and
  # makes it available in queues):
  im.attach_auto_observer

  # Receive messages via the auto-observer
  if im.auto.received?(:message)
    im.auto.received(:message).each do |msg|
      puts msg.body
    end
  end

  # Dettach the auto-observer
  im.dettach_auto_observer

  # See the Jabber::Observable documentation for more information.

= Description

Jabber::Observable is intended to make Jabber client programming simple and
poweful. This library exposes common tasks in messaging, subscription handling
and Publication and Subscription (PubSub) of nodes using a variation of Ruby's
builtin Observer pattern, lowering the need to monitor queues using threads.
For those that still want to use threads, there's an auto-observer that can be
easily attached.
