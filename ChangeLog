xmpp4r-observable (0.5.2)

  * #pubsub@my_nodes was taking a long time since it retrieves all
  subscriptions every time. Now we're managing it within @my_nodes, defined in
  the first call to it... So just the first call take a long time.

xmpp4r-observable (0.5.1)

  * Added .gemspec, README, COPYING and Rakefile.
  * Bump version to 0.5.1 for github release (first public release).
  * Not all is covered by tests, but all that is covered passes.
